-----------------

## Supported Platforms
- Windows
- Linux (since v1.1.0)
- Mac (since v1.1.3)

## Getting Started on Windows
**Step 1:** Download the latest windows installer [here](https://github.com/stratuma/Crunchyroll-Downloader-v4.0/releases).

**Step 2:** Run the installer. The app starts automatically after install and creates a desktop shortcut.

**Thats it!** Now you can start download!

## Getting Started on Linux
**Step 1:** Download one of the latest linux builds [here](https://github.com/stratuma/Crunchyroll-Downloader-v4.0/releases).

**Step 2 for .AppImage:** Just run it, the downloader will appear!

**Step 2 for .deb:** Run the .deb file with your package manager and install it!

**Thats it!** Now you can start download!

## Login Proxies
Since v1.1.3 the downloader uses proxies to log in to crunchyroll, the reason for this is that a lot of content is now geoblocked.

The servers are secure and hosted by big hosters like hetzner and ovh, also no login data is logged.

To deactivate it you just have to go to settings -> proxy and uncheck login proxy.

## DRM Protected Streams
If Crunchyroll disables access to the last DRM free accesspoint I will post a guide on [Discord](https://discord.gg/grGkK4bH95) explaining the widevine stuff and how to bypass it with the downloader.
